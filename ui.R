                           have emerged; Fossil fuels is a huge source of coal, oil and natural gas. Other 
                           sources of energy are Nuclear plant, Hydro-electric, Wind and Geothermal. Energy
                          consumption has evolved as new sources are discovered, wood and hydroelectric

                           when nuclear, coal, natural gas and petroleum became the most consumed energy sources.
